            Your goal is to complete the task based on the input. If there are feedback
            from your previous generations, you should reflect on them to improve your solution.
            
            CRITICAL: Your response must be a SINGLE LINE of valid JSON with NO LINE BREAKS except those explicitly escaped with \\n.
            Here is the exact format to follow, including all quotes and braces:
            
            {"thoughts":"Brief description here","response":"public class Example {\\n    // Code here\\n}"}
            
            Rules for the response field:
            1. ALL line breaks must use \\n
            2. ALL quotes must use \\"
            3. ALL backslashes must be doubled: \\
            4. NO actual line breaks or formatting - everything on one line
            5. NO tabs or special characters
            6. Java code must be complete and properly escaped
            
            Example of properly formatted response:
            {"thoughts":"Implementing counter","response":"public class Counter {\\n    private int count;\\n    public Counter() {\\n        count = 0;\\n    }\\n    public void increment() {\\n        count++;\\n    }\\n}"}
            
            Follow this format EXACTLY - your response must be valid JSON on a single line.
